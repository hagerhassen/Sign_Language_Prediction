Egyptian Sign Language Prediciton Using CNN And LSTM
Hand gestures are one of the nonverbal communication modalities used in sign language. It is most often used by deaf people who have hearing or speech impairments to communicate with other deaf people or even with normal people, so a Deep Learning model is implemented to predict the signs and translate them accurately and that is our mission to help them. The model has been trained over a huge number of labelled videos and processed by Convolutional and LSTM layers. The dynamic visuals were extracted as points in three dimensions by MediaPipe. After using these methodologies in our model, we got a very efficient model with 100% training and validation accuracy, 99.98% in testing, and very accurate results in real-time testing.
